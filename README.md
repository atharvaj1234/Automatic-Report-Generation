# Automatic-Report-Generation

This Python script connects to a MySQL database, fetches data, generates a performance evaluation report for employees, and prints it using the default printer.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `win32print` library (for Windows)
- `mysql.connector` library

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries by running:
`pip install pywin32 mysql-connector-python`

## Usage

1. Replace placeholders in the script with your MySQL database credentials.
2. Adjust the report generation according to your requirements.
3. Run the script:
`python script_name.py`


## Features

- **print_text(text):** Prints the provided text using the default printer.
- **fetch_data_from_database():** Connects to the MySQL database and fetches employee performance data.
- **print_python(data):** Prints a simple Pythonic representation of the fetched data.
- **create_report(data):** Generates a performance evaluation report for employees based on fetched data.
- **main():** Entry point of the script. Fetches data and generates/print reports.

## Adjustments Needed

- Replace placeholder MySQL credentials (`yourhost`, `youruser`, `yourpassword`, `yourdatabase`) with actual credentials.
- Adjust report generation logic (`create_report()`) according to specific evaluation criteria and format requirements.

## Notes

- Ensure the MySQL server is accessible from the script's environment.
- Modify the printing logic (`print_text()`) if different printing requirements exist.

## Disclaimer

- Ensure proper permissions and authorization are in place before executing the script, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
